# Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Overview

This project implements a **Customer Churn Prediction system** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. The objective is to predict whether a customer is likely to **stay with the company or leave (churn)** based on historical customer data. The trained model is integrated into a **Streamlit web application** for interactive prediction and deployment.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and deployment.

## Project Components

### 1. Model Training

* Performed data preprocessing on the churn dataset (encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, handling missing values)
* Designed and trained an ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras
* Optimized the model to capture customer behavior patterns
* Evaluated performance using training and validation metrics

### 2. Model Prediction

* Loaded the trained ANN model
* Accepted customer input features
* Predicted customer outcome:

  * **Customer will stay**
  * **Customer will leave (Churn)**

### 3. Visualization & Deployment

* Developed an interactive web application using **Streamlit**
* Enabled real-time prediction through a user-friendly interface
* Displayed clear and interpretable prediction results
